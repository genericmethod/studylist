# Studylist

Problem : My wife was having a hard time learning and remembering lists for her exams.
Enter Studylist - a little side project I am working on that helps you learn lists.
Current implementation is fairly simple and caters for a single user - my wife.
The application is a scheduled task that performs the following tasks.
 - Randomly selects a list from a json document
 - Sends the list with a missing entry via an email together with a link to the answer.
